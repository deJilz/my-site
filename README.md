# my-site

This repo hosts a website I am building as a personal project. Currently, the site has a weird looking homepage and some demo apps.

I plan to add a project section about my previous work, a blog section to share articles and my thoughts, a gallery of pictures, and some other things I haven't thought of yet.

Everything on this site I have written myself.
